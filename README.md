# GitHub Scroll project

This script allows you to browse popular GitHub repositories from the terminal. You can navigate through the repositories, view their details, and open them in your default web browser.

## Installation

To install, run the install script directly from the internet:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polatengin/skopje/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Usage

Run the script using one of the aliases:

```bash
git-scroll
```

or

```bash
gs
```

### Navigation

- Use the `↑` (Up arrow) key to view the previous repository.
- Use the `↓` (Down arrow) key to view the next repository.
- Press `o` to open the repository in your default web browser.
- Press `q` to quit the script.

### Example

```bash
git-scroll
```

This will fetch the top 100 repositories sorted by stars and allow you to browse through them interactively.
